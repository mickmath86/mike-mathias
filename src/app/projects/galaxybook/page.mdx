Led the production of a social media campaign for Samsung, featuring influencers using the GalaxyBook and other Samsung devices in their creative environments, highlighting the seamless integration and productivity of the Galaxy ecosystem.

## Basics
Samsung approached R/GA for assistance in promoting the new features of their GalaxyBook, as well as its ecosystem that syncs with the Galaxy Ultra and other Samsung devices. As the lead producer, I oversaw the development of a social media campaign that highlighted how seamlessly Samsung’s devices work together to support creativity and productivity.

## The Project
The campaign we developed featured influencers working in their own creative environments, using the GalaxyBook alongside other Samsung devices to complete their creative projects. This approach allowed us to showcase the full range of Samsung's technology in real-world settings. We focused on demonstrating how these devices sync together effortlessly, making it easy for users to transition between tasks and devices. The content was tailored for social media, creating engaging, relatable stories that resonated with the target audience.

## Wrapping Up
The campaign successfully highlighted the key features of the GalaxyBook and Samsung’s connected ecosystem. By leveraging the influence of creative professionals and emphasizing real-world usage, we were able to connect with audiences in an authentic and engaging way. The project reinforced Samsung’s position as a brand that understands the needs of creative professionals and showcased the seamless integration of their devices.
