When you’re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked more realistic than reality itself.

## Basics
Google Play, while widely recognized as a marketplace for apps and content, had lost some of its clarity and relevance within the broader Google ecosystem. The brand had become fragmented across its offerings and global reach, lacking the cohesion needed to thrive on a global scale. As lead producer, I worked with a talented team to help refresh Google Play's identity and unify its brand architecture, creating a brand that could resonate across continents.

## The Project
We identified the opportunity to breathe new life into Google Play’s legacy logo, “the Prism,” turning it from a static symbol into a dynamic representation of discovery. Our team focused on creating a new visual, verbal, and behavioral identity that captured the brand’s multidimensional nature. The goal was to move beyond traditional categories and fandoms, emphasizing that there’s always more to explore on Google Play. My role as lead producer involved overseeing the process, ensuring that the design and development stayed aligned with the project’s vision and that each aspect was executed smoothly.

## Wrapping Up
The rebrand successfully reintroduced Google Play to a global audience, reinforcing its role within the Google ecosystem. We developed comprehensive global brand standards to ensure consistency across all regions and platforms. The new identity was implemented across product interfaces, marketing campaigns, and events like developer conferences, resulting in a cohesive, adaptable brand. As lead producer, I’m proud of the work we did to help create a flexible, unified brand that continues to evolve with its users.
