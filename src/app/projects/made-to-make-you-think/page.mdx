## Basics
We delivered a comprehensive campaign for BBC’s "Made to Make You Think," overseeing the production of films, digital assets, and out-of-home placements, while ensuring consistent messaging across platforms.

## The Project
The project began with a straightforward pitch centered around the strategy to “Restore the grandeur to U.S. news.” The client was immediately drawn to the concept, and after securing the pitch, I stepped in as the lead producer to guide a small, dedicated team through the campaign’s development. Our goal was simple but important: bring this vision to life while keeping everything aligned with the client’s expectations.
The "Made to Make You Think" campaign was anchored by two 60-second films created in collaboration with the edit team at Cosmo Street. 
These films launched across various platforms, including digital, social, and audio, ensuring the message reached the audience no matter where 
they were. The campaign’s out-of-home (OOH) strategy extended its presence across New York City’s iconic transportation hubs and inside nearly 
400 subway cars. The films were further enhanced by a score crafted by Stewart Mitchell from the Bleeding Fingers composer collective, adding a 
distinctive sound that complemented the overall campaign. As lead producer, I worked closely with the creative and development teams to ensure each element, from production to OOH execution, was delivered on time and on point.

## Wrapping Up
The campaign was well-received, successfully delivering a powerful message that resonated with its intended audience. 
We’re already in discussions about the next phase of the project and future opportunities to continue this collaboration. Looking back, the campaign not only met the client’s objectives but also laid the groundwork for potential growth. The overall execution showcased the team’s ability to combine creativity and strategy, producing a message that was thought-provoking and impactful.
