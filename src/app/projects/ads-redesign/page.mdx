## Basics
We led the consolidation and redesign of the [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com), merging multiple web properties into a unified platform with a cohesive UX/UI experience, copy, and tone of voice. Our team managed the entire process, from web development to the creation of the bespoke GADs design system, ensuring consistency and scalability across the platform.

## The Project
As the project lead, I had the responsibility of managing a talented team of creatives and developers to bring the Google Ads website to where it needed to be. The task in front of us was clear: consolidate several Ads-related web properties into one cohesive, user-friendly platform. It wasn’t about making something flashy or groundbreaking; it was about making sure the platform worked for its users—millions of them, every day. The team approached this challenge with the steady focus you'd expect, building a product that was streamlined and intuitive, designed to handle the complexity without feeling complex.

Of course, there’s always more to a project than the big-picture transformation. While we were working on the larger overhaul, we were also managing the daily grind of site operations. Bug fixes, updates, keeping things moving—none of it glamorous, but all of it necessary to keep the lights on. The team worked quietly in the background, anticipating issues before they became problems and ensuring that everything functioned as smoothly as possible. It’s this constant, behind-the-scenes effort that makes the difference, even if no one notices it when things are running well.

One of the more significant achievements was the creation of the GADs design system. This wasn’t something that needed to be bold or groundbreaking either; it simply had to provide consistency across the platform. We built it as a guide—a set of rules that ensured everything looked and functioned in a cohesive way, making future development easier and more efficient for the teams involved. It’s not something users would necessarily see, but it made their experience better, and it gave Google a system that was built to grow.

## Wrapping up
In the end, the project wasn’t about big wins or fanfare. It was about solving problems and making sure the platform could do what it needed to do, and do it well. Our team took a practical approach, focused on creating something sustainable and user-friendly. It wasn’t about raising the stakes or pushing boundaries—it was about making sure the platform worked, day in and day out. And if we had a little fun along the way, well, that’s just part of doing good work.
